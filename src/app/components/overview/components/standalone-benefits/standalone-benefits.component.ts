      'By making NgModules optional, we reduce the amount of code that needs to be written. Instead of having to create both modules and components, you can simply work with components alone. This approach simplifies the learning process, as developers can focus on working with components alone, rather than having to grasp the intricacies of modules. This simplification also empowers components to import only what they need, making the development process more efficient and less complex.',
